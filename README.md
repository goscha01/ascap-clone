# ascap-clone
test assignment for ASCAP front end developer position
Our Online Membership Enrollment application is one of the first places people go to become members of ASCAP.

 

What we would like, is for you to reverse engineer and recreate the "Writer & Publisher" card of the Membership section of OME. The section includes validation that ensures the user has selected a card before being able to continue. If the user selects the "Writer & Publisher" card a drop-down is displayed asking the user for more information. This dropdown also has validation that does not allow the user to continue unless a selection is made. 

 

Things to consider when recreating the Membership section of OME:

· Please avoid a direct copy and paste from our site.

· Please avoid heavy use of npm/3rd party libraries.

· Javascript Library/Framework (your choice of Vue 2 or React)

· SASS/CSS namespacing

· Card Hover effects

· Card and drop-down validation functionality 

· Card and drop-down validation styles

· Custom drop-down styles

· Cancel and continue button

· Browser compatibility (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge)

· Component reusability

· Mobile/Responsive design

Extras (not mandatory and time permitting):

· Unit testing (Jest, Mocha, Chai)
